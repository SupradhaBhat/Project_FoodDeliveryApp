# Project_FoodDeliveryApp
This is my First Web development project
Did this in my 3rd week in the journey of learning HTML and CSS
This is a food delivery app owned by a hotel that delivers the day's food to the doorstep of the customers
The navigation bar has three options - Home, Menu and Contact Us and likewise the webpage consists of the same three sections
I would love to do the further improvisations and update them as and when i learn new things in my learning.
